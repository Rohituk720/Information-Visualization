    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Happens in One Internet Minute?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During one minute, there are 87,500 people tweeting on Twitter, 347,222 people scrolling on Instagram, and 1.4 million people looking for love on Tinder. At the same time, 2.1 million Snaps are snapped on Snap, 41.6 million &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;messages are sent on Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, and 4.8 million GIFs are served by GIPHY.
    Itâ€™s also surprising to hear that 694,444 hours are watched on Netflix every minute, while $996,956 are spent online.
